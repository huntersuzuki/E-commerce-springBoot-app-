# Spring Boot E-Commerce Application

This project is a robust backend application for an e-commerce platform, developed using **Spring Boot**. The
application offers complete CRUD operations for managing products, product categories, and associated product images,
ensuring scalability, modularity, and secure user authentication.

## Features

### 1. **Product Management**

- CRUD operations: Add, delete, update, and retrieve products.
- Seamless integration of product categories and product images using well-defined database relationships.
- Efficient handling of large product datasets.

### 2. **Authentication and Security**

- Implemented **Spring Security** with **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication.
- Secure login functionality for users, ensuring data privacy and preventing unauthorized access.
- Role-based access control can be easily extended for admins, sellers, and customers.

### 3. **RESTful API Design**

- APIs designed following best practices for modularity and maintainability.
- Easy-to-understand endpoints with clear documentation.

### 4. **Database Integration**

- Used **MySQL** as the primary database for backend storage.
- Leveraged **JPA/Hibernate** for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), providing seamless interaction with the database.
- Efficient query performance and proper handling of relationships (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-One).

### 5. **Scalable and Maintainable Architecture**

- Clean code structure with modularized packages for controllers, services, repositories, and models.
- Designed to easily scale and accommodate additional features in the future.
